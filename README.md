# KNN_find_alternative_funds

 Alternative Funds Search using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) This project implements a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model to search for alternative investment funds based on various fund characteristics.

The model helps identify funds that are similar to a given one, allowing investors to explore alternative options efficiently.  How It Works The dataset (maestro.csv and navs.zip) contains multiple funds, each described by several financial and structural attributes.
The KNN algorithm is used to find the most similar funds based on these characteristics. Given a target fund, the model returns its nearest neighbors, i.e., alternative funds with comparable features.

Main Features
 ✅ Data preprocessing: Cleans and prepares the dataset for analysis.
 ✅ KNN model implementation: Computes fund similarity based on selected attributes.
 ✅ Fund recommendation: Identifies alternative funds that match a given profile.
 
 
Helps analyze and interpret results effectively.
